You can run a Backend API by clicking on the top toolbar button “Run Backend API”


To view the response of the API call, or to debug the workflow you can click on “Backend Execution Flow” on the right toolbar.

The execution flow displays all the blocks that have been executed in a sequence. You can expand each node and view its execution time, inputs sent to the block, and the result the block has returned.

You can also view the logs of the API call by clicking on the “View Logs” link on the execution flow tool window.

The logs usually contain information about SQL queries, or REST API calls which can be used to further optimize the performance of your API endpoint.
